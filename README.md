# Deploying your Portfolio on github.io
- Open the package.json file in your project and change the following property:

- "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name",
**This field is not the domain name of your website but rather where your repository is located**

- Replace your-username with your GitHub username and your-repo-name with the name of your GitHub repository.
Save the changes to the package.json file.
**github-gh page dependency and pre-deploy,deploy scripts are already present in the repository**

- Finally, to deploy your app, run the command: **npm run deploy**. 
This will create a branch called gh-pages in your GitHub repository and deploy the contents of the build folder to that branch.
After the deployment is complete, you can access your live Morpholio website at https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name.
**Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to deploy to the repository.**
